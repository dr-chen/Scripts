# Example Scripts

The following is a small sample of scripts I've written to perform various tasks. 

All scripts have been anonymized of sensitive information and have been replaced with placeholder values. 

Most of the code written here was developed anywhere from 2014 - 2017 and does not include work I've recently done from various application deployments, removals, querying databases/REST APIs, generating/parsing YAML/JSON, etc.

I particularly specialize in writing automation middleware especially in the context of an Infrastructure/DevOps/SRE/Application Owner type role. Primary Languages: Python 2/3, Bash, PowerShell, Batch
